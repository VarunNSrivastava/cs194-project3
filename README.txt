Project Structure:
  - main.py: the entire python program. It can be run as-is, but it will take a bit as it will re-generate and save
             every single image in the out/ folder. You can use the main() method to choose which parts of the program
             you would like to run.
  lib/: contains my input images.
  out/: contains my output images.
  out/: used for HTML formatting.
  - README.txt: this file
  - index.html: website
